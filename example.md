# How to write slides?

Split slides by horizontal ruler `---`. It's very simple.

```md
# Slide 1

foobar

---

# Slide 2

foobar
```

> *Notice: Ruler (`<hr>`) is not display in mdSlide.*

---

# TODO

I want to rename this project. The name of "mdSlide" is conflicted to [presentation gem by Ruby](https://github.com/ymrl/mdslide). :sweat:

## Enjoy writing slides! :+1:
